# SQL to Pandas Tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial designed to help SQL users transition to using Python's pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The tutorial covers everything from setting up your environment in Google Colab to performing complex data manipulations that mirror SQL operations, leveraging the powerful pandas library alongside visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn for insightful data analysis.

## What's Inside

- **Setting Up**: Instructions on how to set up your Python environment in Google Colab, making it easy for anyone to follow along without the need for local installations.
- **Fundamentals of Pandas**: An introduction to the core data structures in pandas, such as Series and DataFrames, and how to perform basic data manipulations.
- **Transitioning from SQL to Pandas**: Detailed examples showing how common SQL tasks (querying, filtering, sorting, aggregating, and joining data) can be performed in pandas.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Guides on performing descriptive statistics, aggregations, and various forms of data visualization to extract insights from your data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A step-by-step approach to conducting EDA using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to understand data distributions, correlations, and trends.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes familiarity with SQL and basic database concepts. No prior experience with Python is required, but a basic understanding of programming concepts will be helpful.
